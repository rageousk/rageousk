### Hi, I'm Sahil ( @rageousk ) 👋

I'm a dual-degree student at **Rowan University** (B.S. Computer Science & B.A. Computing & Informatics) passionate about the intersection of cybersecurity and software development.

Currently, I'm an **IT Security Intern at Subaru of America**, diving into Identity & Access Management (IAM) and DevSecOps. I'm also a **Tier-1 Security Analyst** at Rowan University's Security Operations Center (SOC), where I help monitor and protect the university's network.
